### What is this repository for? ###

This is Project 1 of RW354 at Stellenbosch University in 2016.  

### How do I get set up? ###

The source files are all in the src directory.  

Change to the src directory.
Run the following commands:
	
	$ chmod 700 makeserver.sh
	$ chmod 700 startserver.sh
	$ chmod 700 makeclient.sh
	$ chmod 700 startclient.sh
	$ ./makeserver.sh
	$ ./makeclient.sh

To then run either the client or the server:

	$ ./startserver.sh [OPTIONS]

or

	$ ./startclient.sh [OPTIONS]

as needed.


### General Info ###

This is simply a Client Server Chat Program, implemented in java using java's
NIO libraries.  It is for a project during my third year computer science
studies at Stellenbosch University.  Code might contain some copied code in
early commits, but as I progress, these will be removed and rewritten.  The
final version should be my own work, unless otherwise stated.
